  dialogueFull: "Luck: \"Well it\u2019s been fun, dear, but I\u2019m afraid I have
    to depart. As the Goddess of Luck, I have quite a bit of work I need to attend
    to. Those gamblers won\u2019t swindle themselves.\"\n\"Don\u2019t worry. I can
    cover the bill for you, since I know you aren\u2019t as\u2026how do I say\u2026well
    off, unlike me.\"\nYou pucker your lips, insulted by her implications. You\u2019re
    unsure if she\u2019s trying to make you foot the bill, but you can\u2019t find
    yourself to care. At this point, you feel like it\u2019s an attack on your pride
    if you're not the one to pay.\nShe sees your indignation and scoffs.\n\u201CWhat,
    you think I\u2019m trying to scam you into paying the bill?\u201D\nYou lean back
    and take a sip of your water. It\u2019s exactly what you're implying. You see
    her lips curl in frustration.\n\u201CHow dare you! I am Lady Luck. I don\u2019t
    need a mortal to cover for me. I was trying to be nice.\"\nYou raise your eyebrows
    questioningly. Yeah right.\nShe looks surprised.\n\u201CYou seriously don\u2019t
    believe me? Fine then. How about we make this interesting and let the dice decide.
    Let\u2019s see who\u2019s going to pay tonight.\u201D\nYou crack your knuckles.
    Tonight, there is only going to be one victor, and it\u2019s going to be you.
    You WILL be the one paying the bill."
