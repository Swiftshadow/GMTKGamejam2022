  dialogueFull: "The FitnessGram\u2122 Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity
    test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer
    test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts
    slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single
    lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run
    in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to
    complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the
    word start. On your mark, get ready, start.\r"
